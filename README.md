## **What This Project Does**  
### 1. Vortex Tube Cooling System  
- **Objective**: Design a vortex tube-based thermal management system (TMS) for a 25 kWh Li-ion battery pack.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Uses compressed air to cool batteries, maintaining temperature at **40°C** under fast-charging conditions.  
  - Integrates EXAIR Model 3202 vortex tubes for efficient heat dissipation.  
  - Achieves **25% higher cooling efficiency** compared to liquid cooling systems.  

### 2. Synthetic Jet (Nuventix SynJet) Cooling System  
- **Objective**: Develop a lightweight, energy-efficient TMS using pulsating airflow from synthetic jets.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Deploys Nuventix M Series SynJets for uniform temperature distribution (±2°C).  
  - Reduces energy consumption by **10%** vs. traditional fan-based cooling.  
  - Adds only **3.6 kg** of extra mass to the vehicle.

## **Why This Project Is Useful**  
- **Sustainability**: Both systems eliminate refrigerants, reducing environmental impact.  
- **Cost-Effectiveness**:  
  - Vortex tube system cuts costs by **15%** vs. liquid cooling.  
  - SynJet system reduces manufacturing complexity.  
- **Innovation**: Novel applications of vortex tube/SynJet technologies in EV battery cooling.  
- **Scalability**: Designs can be adapted for larger battery packs (50+ kWh).
